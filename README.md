My personal port of [trash-cli](https://github.com/andreafrancia/trash-cli/) to rust using an improved CLI &amp; Implemented in Rust. Last year I opened [an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/andreafrancia/trash-cli/issues/290) to propose to update the existing trash CLI written in Python to use subcommands instead of have separate commands for each trash operation (put, list, remove, etc). Now that I have time, I have decided to make a spiritual fork of that project written in Rust for the sake of my own learning as well embracing new technology.
